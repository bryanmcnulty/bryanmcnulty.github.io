Pinned is an easy-difficulty mobile challenge created by [**bertolis**](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/27897) on [**Hack the Box**](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/pinned) where our job is to reverse-engineer an android application to find the flag.

> This app has stored my credentials and I can only login automatically. I tried to intercept the login request and restore my password, but this seems to be a secure connection. Can you help bypass this security restriction and intercept the password in plaintext?

## Introduction

In this challenge we are given an APK package called `pinned.apk`{:.filepath} and a text file called `README.txt`{:.filepath}. The challenge description explains that the subject has their credentials stored in this APK application. It also ends with a question implying that we will not conduct any static analysis and we will be bypassing some security measures. Finally, the `README.txt`{:.filepath} file contains a message stating that we must install the application on a device running Android 10.0 or any version with API level 29 or earlier.

## Genymotion

We will use [Genymotion](https://www-v1.genymotion.com/download-trial/) to create and interact with an Android virtual machine. 

### Creating a Virtual Machine

First we open Genymotion on our desktop and press **Ctrl+N** to create a new virtual machine. Then we select Google Pixel 3 from the menu and verify that Android version is set to **10.0.0**. Once that is done, we click **NEXT** and assign the hardware resources for the VM. We can keep the default configuration for the Display options and Android options then install the VM.

### Installing Applications

To install the `pinned.apk`{:.filepath} application, we boot the VM then use the `adb` program.

```bash
sudo apt-get install adb # install adb
adb install pinned.apk # install pinned.apk on the virtual machine
```
{:.nolineno}

Once this is done, we can open the new app by navigating to our VM's screen and clicking **Pinned** in the app menu.

## BurpSuite

### Proxy Setup

Let's set up [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) to try to intercept any traffic sent by this application. First we go to **_Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners > Add_** and check **All interfaces** then and enable interception in the proxy tab.

### Connect to Proxy

To connect to the proxy we run a command on the guest device to change the global setting `http_proxy` to the address of the host machine's proxy server.

```bash
lhost="192.168.1.2" # Change me
lport="8080"
adb root
adb shell "settings put global http_proxy $lhost:$lport"
```
{:.nolineno}

This should temporarily connect the guest device to the BurpSuite proxy.

Now when we open the app and click the login button, we get an error on the BurpSuite dashboard claiming that the connection to _https://pinned.com:443_ failed. This could mean that the application implements [certificate pinning](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning).

## Bypassing Certificate Pinning

To bypass the certificate pinning here we will use a dynamic code instrumentation framework known as [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida).

### Starting the Server

We first download and extract the Frida server executable for our target OS and architecture.

```bash
target_os="android"
target_arch="$(adb shell 'getprop ro.product.cpu.abi')"
binary="frida-server-16.0.6-$target_os-$target_arch.xz"
wget "https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.0.6/$binary"
unxz $binary
```
{:.nolineno}

Then we upload the binary to the android filesystem and run it.

```bash
location="/data/local/tmp/frida"
adb push ./frida-server* "$location"
adb shell "chmod +x $location"
adb shell "$location" &
```
{:.nolineno}

### Universal Pinning Bypass Script

We will be using [this script](https://codeshare.frida.re/@pcipolloni/universal-android-ssl-pinning-bypass-with-frida/) alongside Frida to effectively bypass certificate pinning. This script expects our custom certificate at `/data/local/temp/cert-der.crt`{:.filepath} which will be BurpSuite's certificate in DER format.

Once we have exported BurpSuite's certificate we upload it to the expected location.

```bash
adb push ./burp.crt "/data/local/tmp/cert-der.crt"
```
{:.nolineno}

Then we locate the identifier for the application.

```bash
frida-ps -U -ai | grep -i "pinned"
```
{:.nolineno}

The identifier for the suspected process is **com.example.pinned**. Let's run Frida with the bypass script on this process.

```bash
frida -U \
  --codeshare "pcipolloni/universal-android-ssl-pinning-bypass-with-frida" \
  -f "com.example.pinned"
```
{:.nolineno}

Now when we login on the open window in the virtual machine, we intercept the login attempt with the flag.
